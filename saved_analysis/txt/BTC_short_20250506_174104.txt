  â””â”€ Volatility measures price fluctuation magnitude. It's calculated as the percentage range between high 
and low prices relative to the low price. This value falls into the 'moderate daily volatility' range 
(2-5%), which is typical of normal market conditions.
  â””â”€ Period return measures price change as a percentage over the analyzed timeframe, calculated as 
((current_price - starting_price) / starting_price) * 100. This value indicates sideways price action, 
typical of consolidation or indecision phases.

TECHNICAL INDICATORS:

Trend:
  - MACD: Bullish
    â”œâ”€ Line: 588.3188
    â”œâ”€ Signal: 246.2273
    â””â”€ Histogram: 342.0915
    Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) consists of the MACD line (difference between
two EMAs), signal line (EMA of the MACD line), and histogram (difference between MACD and signal lines). 
Interpretation: When MACD crosses above the signal line, it's a potential buy signal; when it 
crosses below, a potential sell signal. The histogram shows momentum: increasing bars suggest strengthening
momentum, decreasing bars suggest weakening momentum. MACD is particularly valuable in crypto markets for 
identifying potential reversals and trend strength.
  - SMA: Bullish
    Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculates the average price over a specified period, giving 
equal weight to each price point. Interpretation: When price is above the SMA, it suggests bullish
sentiment; when below, bearish sentiment. Longer period SMAs (50-200) indicate long-term trends, while 
shorter ones (5-20) show short-term momentum. Cryptocurrency traders often watch for price crossing 
above/below key SMAs or for SMA crossovers as potential entry/exit signals.
  - ADX: Strong Trend
    â””â”€ Value: 35.55
    Average Directional Index (ADX) measures trend strength regardless of direction. 
Interpretation: Values below 20 indicate a weak trend or ranging market; values above 25 indicate a
strong trend. Higher values mean stronger trends, not higher prices. ADX doesn't show trend direction, only
strength. In crypto markets, which can experience extended periods of sideways movement, ADX helps traders 
determine whether trend-following strategies are appropriate.
  - ICHIMOKU: Bullish
    â”œâ”€ Tenkan-sen (Conversion): 96193.71
    â”œâ”€ Kijun-sen (Base): 95768.87
    â”œâ”€ Senkou Span A (Leading A): 94024.75
    â”œâ”€ Senkou Span B (Leading B): 94024.75
    â””â”€ Chikou Span (Lagging): 97199.06

Momentum:
  - RSI: Overbought
    â””â”€ Value: 83.18
    Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and magnitude of price movements on a scale
from 0 to 100. Interpretation: Traditionally, values above 70 indicate overbought conditions 
(potential sell signal); values below 30 indicate oversold conditions (potential buy signal). In stronger 
trends, these thresholds may shift (80/20 for strong markets). Cryptocurrency markets can maintain 
overbought/oversold conditions longer than traditional markets, so look for divergences and pattern breaks 
rather than relying solely on threshold values.
  - STOCHASTIC: Overbought
    â”œâ”€ %K: 93.03
    â””â”€ %D: 90.92
  - CCI: Overbought
    â””â”€ Value: 233.30
    Commodity Channel Index (CCI) measures a security's price deviation from its statistical 
average. Interpretation: Values above +100 indicate potential overbought conditions; values below 
-100 indicate potential oversold conditions. Crossing from negative to positive territory may signal 
bullish momentum; crossing from positive to negative may signal bearish momentum. CCI can be particularly 
useful in crypto markets for identifying potential price extremes and trend reversals.

Volatility:
  - BOLLINGER: Neutral
    â”œâ”€ Upper Band: 97567.72
    â”œâ”€ Middle Band: 95660.09
    â”œâ”€ Lower Band: 93752.47
    â”œâ”€ Price: 97199.06
    â””â”€ Position: 1.61% from middle
  - ATR: Low Volatility
    â””â”€ Value: 304.68
    Average True Range (ATR) measures market volatility by calculating the average range between
high and low prices. Interpretation: Higher ATR values indicate higher volatility; lower values 
indicate lower volatility. ATR doesn't provide directional signals but helps set appropriate stop-loss 
levels and profit targets. Given cryptocurrency's high volatility, ATR is essential for risk management, 
helping traders set stops that account for normal market fluctuations.

Volume:
  - OBV: Confirming Downtrend
    â””â”€ Value: -2575766528.0
    On-Balance Volume (OBV) adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days to show 
buying and selling pressure. Interpretation: Rising OBV suggests positive volume pressure (buying);
falling OBV suggests negative volume pressure (selling). Divergences between OBV and price may signal 
potential reversals. In crypto markets, where volume can indicate institutional interest, OBV helps 
validate price movements and identify potential manipulated rallies or selloffs.
