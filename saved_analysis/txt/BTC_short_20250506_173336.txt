  └─ Volatility measures price fluctuation magnitude. It's calculated as the percentage range
between high and low prices relative to the low price. This value falls into the 'moderate 
daily volatility' range (2-5%), which is typical of normal market conditions.
  └─ Period return measures price change as a percentage over the analyzed timeframe, 
calculated as ((current_price - starting_price) / starting_price) * 100. This value indicates
sideways price action, typical of consolidation or indecision phases.

TECHNICAL INDICATORS:

Trend:
  - MACD: Bullish
    ├─ Line: 594.2362
    ├─ Signal: 250.9613
    └─ Histogram: 343.2750
    Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) consists of the MACD line 
(difference between two EMAs), signal line (EMA of the MACD line), and histogram (difference 
between MACD and signal lines). Interpretation: When MACD crosses above the signal 
line, it's a potential buy signal; when it crosses below, a potential sell signal. The 
histogram shows momentum: increasing bars suggest strengthening momentum, decreasing bars 
suggest weakening momentum. MACD is particularly valuable in crypto markets for identifying 
potential reversals and trend strength.
  - SMA: Bullish
    Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculates the average price over a specified 
period, giving equal weight to each price point. Interpretation: When price is above
the SMA, it suggests bullish sentiment; when below, bearish sentiment. Longer period SMAs 
(50-200) indicate long-term trends, while shorter ones (5-20) show short-term momentum. 
Cryptocurrency traders often watch for price crossing above/below key SMAs or for SMA 
crossovers as potential entry/exit signals.
  - ADX: Strong Trend
    └─ Value: 35.55
    Average Directional Index (ADX) measures trend strength regardless of 
direction. Interpretation: Values below 20 indicate a weak trend or ranging market; 
values above 25 indicate a strong trend. Higher values mean stronger trends, not higher 
prices. ADX doesn't show trend direction, only strength. In crypto markets, which can 
experience extended periods of sideways movement, ADX helps traders determine whether 
trend-following strategies are appropriate.
  - ICHIMOKU: Bullish
    ├─ Tenkan-sen (Conversion): 96193.71
    ├─ Kijun-sen (Base): 95768.87
    ├─ Senkou Span A (Leading A): 94024.75
    ├─ Senkou Span B (Leading B): 94024.75
    └─ Chikou Span (Lagging): 97273.24

Momentum:
  - RSI: Overbought
    └─ Value: 83.75
    Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and magnitude of price 
movements on a scale from 0 to 100. Interpretation: Traditionally, values above 70 
indicate overbought conditions (potential sell signal); values below 30 indicate oversold 
conditions (potential buy signal). In stronger trends, these thresholds may shift (80/20 for 
strong markets). Cryptocurrency markets can maintain overbought/oversold conditions longer 
than traditional markets, so look for divergences and pattern breaks rather than relying 
solely on threshold values.
  - STOCHASTIC: Overbought
    ├─ %K: 93.86
    └─ %D: 91.20
  - CCI: Overbought
    └─ Value: 238.10
    Commodity Channel Index (CCI) measures a security's price deviation from its
statistical average. Interpretation: Values above +100 indicate potential overbought
conditions; values below -100 indicate potential oversold conditions. Crossing from negative 
to positive territory may signal bullish momentum; crossing from positive to negative may 
signal bearish momentum. CCI can be particularly useful in crypto markets for identifying 
potential price extremes and trend reversals.

Volatility:
  - BOLLINGER: Neutral
    ├─ Upper Band: 97599.44
    ├─ Middle Band: 95667.51
    ├─ Lower Band: 93735.58
    ├─ Price: 97273.24
    └─ Position: 1.68% from middle
  - ATR: Low Volatility
    └─ Value: 300.40
    Average True Range (ATR) measures market volatility by calculating the average
range between high and low prices. Interpretation: Higher ATR values indicate higher
volatility; lower values indicate lower volatility. ATR doesn't provide directional signals 
but helps set appropriate stop-loss levels and profit targets. Given cryptocurrency's high 
volatility, ATR is essential for risk management, helping traders set stops that account for 
normal market fluctuations.

Volume:
  - OBV: Neutral
    └─ Value: -956718080.0
    On-Balance Volume (OBV) adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down 
days to show buying and selling pressure. Interpretation: Rising OBV suggests positive
volume pressure (buying); falling OBV suggests negative volume pressure (selling). 
Divergences between OBV and price may signal potential reversals. In crypto markets, where 
volume can indicate institutional interest, OBV helps validate price movements and identify 
potential manipulated rallies or selloffs.
