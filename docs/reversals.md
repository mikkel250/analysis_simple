## Additional Indicators for Spotting Reversals

- **Stochastic Oscillator**  
  Measures momentum and overbought/oversold conditions. A bullish reversal is often signaled when %K crosses above %D below 20; bearish when %K crosses below %D above 80[2][6].
  Why: Like RSI, it identifies overbought/oversold conditions but can be more sensitive to short-term momentum changes.
  Benefit: Confirms momentum shifts and can validate RSI signals

- **Bollinger Bands**  
  Watch for price touching or piercing the outer bands, especially with a reversal candlestick pattern. A move from the lower band back inside the bands often signals a potential bullish reversal, and vice versa for bearish[6][7].

- **Moving Averages (MA) & Crossovers**  
  Short-term moving averages (like 9 or 21 EMA) crossing above longer-term ones (like 50 EMA) can confirm a bullish reversal. Price crossing above/below key MAs is also a strong signal[6][7].

- **Volume Analysis**  
  A spike in volume on a reversal candle or breakout strengthens the validity of the reversal-low volume can mean a false move[6].

- **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**  
  Reversals often occur at key Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%). If price stalls or reverses at these levels, it adds weight to other signals[6].

- **Donchian & Keltner Channels**  
  Breakouts above or below these channels can indicate trend reversals, especially when confirmed by other indicators[7].

- **Candlestick Patterns**  
  Patterns like hammers, engulfing, or doji at support/resistance or after a strong move can signal reversals-combine with your indicators for higher accuracy[6][7].

## Combining Indicators

- Use **multiple confirmations**: e.g., RSI oversold, bullish engulfing candle, and price breaking above the 9 EMA with a volume spike.
- Avoid relying on a single indicator-layer signals for higher probability trades.
