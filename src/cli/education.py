# Individual indicator explanations
INDICATOR_EXPLANATIONS = {
    "sma": (
        f"{indicator_name('Simple Moving Average (SMA)')} calculates the average price over a specified "
        f"period, giving equal weight to each price point. {highlight('Interpretation:')} When price is "
        f"above the SMA, it suggests bullish sentiment; when below, bearish sentiment. Longer period "
        f"SMAs (50-200) indicate long-term trends, while shorter ones (5-20) show short-term momentum. "
        f"Cryptocurrency traders often watch for price crossing above/below key SMAs or for SMA crossovers "
        f"as potential entry/exit signals."
    ),
    
    "ema": (
        f"{indicator_name('Exponential Moving Average (EMA)')} is similar to SMA but gives more weight to "
        f"recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. {highlight('Interpretation:')} Price "
        f"above EMA suggests bullish momentum; price below suggests bearish momentum. EMAs respond faster "
        f"to price changes than SMAs, potentially providing earlier trend change signals. In crypto markets, "
        f"which can change direction rapidly, EMAs are often preferred for their greater sensitivity."
    ),
    
    "macd": (
        f"{indicator_name('Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)')} consists of the MACD line (difference "
        f"between two EMAs), signal line (EMA of the MACD line), and histogram (difference between MACD and "
        f"signal lines). {highlight('Interpretation:')} When MACD crosses above the signal line, it's a potential "
        f"buy signal; when it crosses below, a potential sell signal. The histogram shows momentum: increasing "
        f"bars suggest strengthening momentum, decreasing bars suggest weakening momentum. MACD is particularly "
        f"valuable in crypto markets for identifying potential reversals and trend strength."
    ),
    
    "adx": (
        f"{indicator_name('Average Directional Index (ADX)')} measures trend strength regardless of direction. "
        f"{highlight('Interpretation:')} Values below 20 indicate a weak trend or ranging market; values above "
        f"25 indicate a strong trend. Higher values mean stronger trends, not higher prices. ADX doesn't show "
        f"trend direction, only strength. In crypto markets, which can experience extended periods of sideways "
        f"movement, ADX helps traders determine whether trend-following strategies are appropriate."
    ),
    
    "rsi": (
        f"{indicator_name('Relative Strength Index (RSI)')} measures the speed and magnitude of price movements "
        f"on a scale from 0 to 100. {highlight('Interpretation:')} Traditionally, values above 70 indicate "
        f"overbought conditions (potential sell signal); values below 30 indicate oversold conditions (potential "
        f"buy signal). In stronger trends, these thresholds may shift (80/20 for strong markets). Cryptocurrency "
        f"markets can maintain overbought/oversold conditions longer than traditional markets, so look for "
        f"divergences and pattern breaks rather than relying solely on threshold values."
    ),
    
    "stoch": (
        f"{indicator_name('Stochastic Oscillator')} compares a closing price to its price range over a given time "
        f"period. It consists of %K (fast stochastic) and %D (slow stochastic) lines. {highlight('Interpretation:')} "
        f"Readings above 80 indicate overbought conditions; readings below 20 indicate oversold conditions. "
        f"A %K crossing above %D is a potential buy signal; crossing below is a potential sell signal. "
        f"In crypto markets, the stochastic oscillator works well for identifying potential reversal points "
        f"during sideways movements."
    ),
    
    "cci": (
        f"{indicator_name('Commodity Channel Index (CCI)')} measures a security's price deviation from its "
        f"statistical average. {highlight('Interpretation:')} Values above +100 indicate potential overbought "
        f"conditions; values below -100 indicate potential oversold conditions. Crossing from negative to "
        f"positive territory may signal bullish momentum; crossing from positive to negative may signal "
        f"bearish momentum. CCI can be particularly useful in crypto markets for identifying potential "
        f"price extremes and trend reversals."
    ),
    
    "bbands": (
        f"{indicator_name('Bollinger Bands')} consist of a middle band (typically a 20-period SMA) and two outer "
        f"bands set at standard deviations from the middle band. {highlight('Interpretation:')} Price touching "
        f"or exceeding the upper band suggests overbought conditions; touching the lower band suggests oversold "
        f"conditions. Band width indicates volatility: wider bands mean higher volatility; narrower bands mean "
        f"lower volatility. In crypto markets, known for their volatility, Bollinger Bands help identify potential "
        f"price breakouts and extremes."
    ),
    
    "atr": (
        f"{indicator_name('Average True Range (ATR)')} measures market volatility by calculating the average range "
        f"between high and low prices. {highlight('Interpretation:')} Higher ATR values indicate higher volatility; "
        f"lower values indicate lower volatility. ATR doesn't provide directional signals but helps set appropriate "
        f"stop-loss levels and profit targets. Given cryptocurrency's high volatility, ATR is essential for risk "
        f"management, helping traders set stops that account for normal market fluctuations."
    ),
    
    "obv": (
        f"{indicator_name('On-Balance Volume (OBV)')} adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days to "
        f"show buying and selling pressure. {highlight('Interpretation:')} Rising OBV suggests positive volume "
        f"pressure (buying); falling OBV suggests negative volume pressure (selling). Divergences between OBV and "
        f"price may signal potential reversals. In crypto markets, where volume can indicate institutional interest, "
        f"OBV helps validate price movements and identify potential manipulated rallies or selloffs."
