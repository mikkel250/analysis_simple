PRICE INFORMATION:
Current Price: 96567.30
24H change: -0.31%
Volatility: 2.25%
  └─ Volatility measures price fluctuation magnitude. It's calculated as the percentage range between high and low prices relative to the low price. This value falls 
into the 'moderate daily volatility' range (2-5%), which is typical of normal market conditions.
  └─ Period return measures price change as a percentage over the analyzed timeframe, calculated as ((current_price - starting_price) / starting_price) * 100. This 
value indicates sideways price action, typical of consolidation or indecision phases.

TECHNICAL INDICATORS:

Trend:
  - MACD: Bullish
    ├─ Line: 401.9521
    ├─ Signal: -136.1727
    └─ Histogram: 538.1247
    Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) consists of the MACD line (difference between two EMAs), signal line (EMA of the MACD line), and histogram 
(difference between MACD and signal lines). Interpretation: When MACD crosses above the signal line, it's a potential buy signal; when it crosses below, a potential 
sell signal. The histogram shows momentum: increasing bars suggest strengthening momentum, decreasing bars suggest weakening momentum. MACD is particularly valuable 
in crypto markets for identifying potential reversals and trend strength.
  - SMA: Neutral
    Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculates the average price over a specified period, giving equal weight to each price point. Interpretation: When price is above the
SMA, it suggests bullish sentiment; when below, bearish sentiment. Longer period SMAs (50-200) indicate long-term trends, while shorter ones (5-20) show short-term 
momentum. Cryptocurrency traders often watch for price crossing above/below key SMAs or for SMA crossovers as potential entry/exit signals.
  - ADX: Strong Trend
    └─ Value: 43.92
    Average Directional Index (ADX) measures trend strength regardless of direction. Interpretation: Values below 20 indicate a weak trend or ranging market; values 
above 25 indicate a strong trend. Higher values mean stronger trends, not higher prices. ADX doesn't show trend direction, only strength. In crypto markets, which can
experience extended periods of sideways movement, ADX helps traders determine whether trend-following strategies are appropriate.
  - ICHIMOKU: Strong Bullish
    ├─ Tenkan-sen (Conversion): 97053.20
    ├─ Kijun-sen (Base): 96045.61
    ├─ Senkou Span A (Leading A): 94749.68
    ├─ Senkou Span B (Leading B): 94292.20
    └─ Chikou Span (Lagging): 96567.30

Momentum:
  - RSI: Neutral
    └─ Value: 54.20
    Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and magnitude of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100. Interpretation: Traditionally, values above 70 
indicate overbought conditions (potential sell signal); values below 30 indicate oversold conditions (potential buy signal). In stronger trends, these thresholds may 
shift (80/20 for strong markets). Cryptocurrency markets can maintain overbought/oversold conditions longer than traditional markets, so look for divergences and 
pattern breaks rather than relying solely on threshold values.
  - STOCHASTIC: Bearish Crossover
    ├─ %K: 19.03
    └─ %D: 35.70
  - CCI: Neutral
    └─ Value: -35.10
    Commodity Channel Index (CCI) measures a security's price deviation from its statistical average. Interpretation: Values above +100 indicate potential overbought 
conditions; values below -100 indicate potential oversold conditions. Crossing from negative to positive territory may signal bullish momentum; crossing from positive
to negative may signal bearish momentum. CCI can be particularly useful in crypto markets for identifying potential price extremes and trend reversals.

Volatility:
  - BOLLINGER: Neutral
    ├─ Upper Band: 97752.66
    ├─ Middle Band: 97085.03
    ├─ Lower Band: 96417.40
    ├─ Price: 96567.30
    └─ Position: -0.53% from middle
  - ATR: Low Volatility
    └─ Value: 219.44
    Average True Range (ATR) measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices. Interpretation: Higher ATR values indicate 
higher volatility; lower values indicate lower volatility. ATR doesn't provide directional signals but helps set appropriate stop-loss levels and profit targets. 
Given cryptocurrency's high volatility, ATR is essential for risk management, helping traders set stops that account for normal market fluctuations.

Volume:
  - OBV: Confirming Downtrend
    └─ Value: -5048265728.0
    On-Balance Volume (OBV) adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days to show buying and selling pressure. Interpretation: Rising OBV suggests positive
volume pressure (buying); falling OBV suggests negative volume pressure (selling). Divergences between OBV and price may signal potential reversals. In crypto 
markets, where volume can indicate institutional interest, OBV helps validate price movements and identify potential manipulated rallies or selloffs.
