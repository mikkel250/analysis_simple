momentum: increasing bars suggest strengthening momentum,

valuable in crypto markets for identifying potential reversals and
trend strength.

period SMAs [1m([0m[1;36m50[0m-[1;36m200[0m[1m)[0m indicate long-term trends, while shorter ones

watch for price crossing above/below key SMAs or for SMA 
crossovers as potential entry/exit signals.

higher prices. ADX doesn't show trend direction, only strength. In
crypto markets, which can experience extended periods of sideways 
movement, ADX helps traders determine whether trend-following 
strategies are appropriate.

crypto markets for identifying potential price extremes and trend 
reversals.
