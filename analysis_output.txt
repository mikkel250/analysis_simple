identifying potential reversals and trend strength.

shorter ones [1m([0m[1;36m5[0m-[1;36m20[0m[1m)[0m show short-term momentum. Cryptocurrency traders often watch for price crossing

strength. In crypto markets, which can experience extended periods of sideways movement, ADX helps traders 
determine whether trend-following strategies are appropriate.
